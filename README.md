# 🤖 Traffic Sign Classifier
### Image Processing & Machine Learning Pipeline

This project features an end-to-end computer vision pipeline developed in Python to preprocess raw image data, extract geometric features, and classify traffic signs.

## 🚀 Project Overview
I developed a system capable of classifying , images specifically traffic signs ,by extracting shape and color-based features and applying machine learning algorithms. 

### **Key Technical Workflow**
* **Preprocessing**: Normalization, 100x100 resizing, and linearization to standardize input data.
* **Feature Engineering**: Extracted HSV color profiles and implemented Sobel filters for high-precision edge detection.
* **Geometry Tracking**: Leveraged Hough Transforms to count lines and detect circular patterns.

## 📊 Model Performance
I evaluated three distinct models, with **Logistic Regression** proving the most effective for this specific dataset.

| Model | Accuracy | Methodology |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Logistic Regression** | **91.84%** | Probability-based classification via Sigmoid functions. |
| **KNN** | **91.00%** | Feature similarity and Euclidean distance. |
| **Decision Tree** | **90.21%** | Iterative splitting based on information gain. |
